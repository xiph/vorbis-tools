This repository contains the source code for **vorbis-tools**, a set of command-line utilities for working with Ogg Vorbis audio files.

The audio codec libraries for use with Ogg bitstreams (libvorbis, libspeex, libflac) are contained in other modules.

## Tools Included

This distribution includes the following command-line tools:

*   **`oggenc`**: The Ogg Vorbis encoder.
*   **`oggdec`**: A simple, portable decoder to convert Ogg Vorbis files to WAV or raw audio.
*   **`ogg123`**: A command-line audio player for Ogg Vorbis, FLAC, and Speex files.
*   **`ogginfo`**: Displays information (tags, bitrate, length, etc.) about Ogg files.
*   **`vorbiscomment`**: Edits the comments in Ogg Vorbis files.
*   **`vcut`**: Cuts an Ogg Vorbis file into two parts at a specified point.

## Dependencies

### Required
All tools require `libogg` and `libvorbis` to be installed (along with their header files).
*   **libogg & libvorbis**: [https://xiph.org/vorbis/](https://xiph.org/vorbis/)

### Tool-Specific Dependencies
*   **`ogg123` requires:**
    *   `libao`: [https://xiph.org/ao/](https://xiph.org/ao/)
    *   `libcurl`: [http://curl.haxx.se/libcurl/](http://curl.haxx.se/libcurl/)
    *   A POSIX-compatible thread library.

### Optional
*   **`ogg123` can optionally use:**
    *   `libFLAC` (for FLAC playback): [https://xiph.org/flac/](https://xiph.org/flac/)
    *   `libspeex` (for Speex playback): [https://www.speex.org/](https://www.speex.org/)
*   **`oggenc` can optionally use:**
    *   `libFLAC` (for encoding from FLAC files)
    *   `libkate`: [https://github.com/xiph/libkate](https://github.com/xiph/libkate)

## Building from Source

### Building from Tarball (Stable Release)
For builds from a release tarball, run the following commands:
```sh
./configure
make
```
To install the tools (usually to `/usr/local/bin`), run as root:
```sh
sudo make install
```

### Building from Git (Developer Build)
If you have cloned this repository from Git, you must first generate the `configure` script.
```sh
./autogen.sh
make
```
To install the tools, run as root:
```sh
sudo make install
```

### Building on Windows with MinGW
To build on Windows using the MinGW-w64 environment:
```sh
AUTOMAKE_FLAGS=--include-deps ./autogen.sh

# Configure to install into your MinGW tree (e.g., /mingw64).
# This makes the tools available in your MinGW shell.
./configure --prefix=/mingw64 
make
make install

# Verify that the tools are in your path
which oggenc
```

### Building RPMs
RPM packages can be built after running `./autogen.sh` or `./configure`:
```sh
make dist
rpm -ta vorbis-tools-<version>.tar.gz
```

### Cleaning Up
To remove files generated by the build process:
```sh
# Remove object files and executables
make clean
```

To remove all files generated by `configure` and `automake`:
```sh
make maintainer-clean
```

## Known Bugs

> **Bug #1321: `ogg123` status message spam**
>
> First noticed in non-English versions of the application, `ogg123` has a major bug when it comes to status messages in the shell: any output longer than the console's width will break and start spamming that message infinitely until the console is resized.
>
> Different attempts to fix this bug have ended up causing bigger problems, leading to the conclusion that it simply can't be fixed without a large re-write of the application, which will not happen any time soon. If you come across this issue, please increase your terminal window size as a workaround.
