WHAT'S HERE:

This source distribution includes the vorbis tools and nothing else.  Other 
modules (eg, the modules vorbis, vorbis-tools and vorbis-plugins for the 
Vorbis codec) contain the codec libraries for use with Ogg bitstreams.

DIRECTORIES:

debian/		debian packaging stuff
include/	header files shared between the tools
intl/		GNU gettext library from gettext-0.10.40 (for i18n support)
ogg123/		an ogg vorbis command line audio player
oggenc/		the ogg vorbis encoder
oggdec/		a simple, portable command line decoder (to wav and raw)
ogginfo/	provides information (tags, bitrate, length, etc.) about 
		an ogg vorbis file
po/		translations for non-English languages
share/		code shared between the tools
vcut/		cuts an ogg vorbis file into two parts at a particular point
vorbiscomment/	edits the comments in an ogg vorbis file
win32/		Win32 build stuff

DEPENDENCIES:

All of the tools require libogg and libvorbis to be installed (along
with the header files).  Additionally, ogg123 requires libao, libcurl,
and a POSIX-compatible thread library.  Ogg123 can optionally compiled
to use libFLAC, libOggFLAC, and libspeex.  Oggenc can be optionally
compiled with libFLAC and libOggFLAC.  The libraries libogg,
libvorbis, and libao are all available at
  http://www.vorbis.com/download.psp

The libcurl library is packaged with most Linux distributions.  The
source code can also be downloaded from:
  http://curl.haxx.se/libcurl/

FLAC is available at:
  http://flac.sourceforge.net

Speex is available at:
  http://www.speex.org/
